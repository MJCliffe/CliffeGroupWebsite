      <description>matthew.cliffe[at]nottingham.ac.uk Matt is an Associate Professor at the University of Nottingham.
He received his DPhil (2015) at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Goodwin on the characterization of disordered framework materials. He then took up a Research Fellowship at Sidney Sussex College at the University of Cambridge, where he worked with Prof. Clare Grey in the Department of Chemistry, before moving to the University of Nottingham in 2018 as the inaugural Hobday Fellow, being promoted to Assistant Professor in 2021 and Associate Professor in 2023.</description>

      <description>rinku.kushwaha[at]nottingham.ac.uk Rinku joined the Cliffe group as a Postdoctoral Research Associate (PDRA). His research explores the magnetic and conducting properties resulting from doping in metal–organic frameworks (MOF). He comes from Uttar Pradesh, India. Rinku obtained his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree from the University of Allahabad and later joined the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, for an integrated MS-PhD program. He completed his Ph.D. in Chemistry under the supervision of Prof.</description>

      <description>pcymrge[at]nottingham.ac.uk Maddie re-joined the Cliffe group as a PhD student in October 2020, after doing a MSci project (18-19). Her studies concentrate on the magnetic properties of metal thiocyanate frameworks and how they can be controlled through doping the structures with alternative metals. She has a focus on neutron diffraction measurements, so she is based at the Institut Laue-Langevin neutron research centre, where she is co-supervised by Dr Laura Cañadillas-Delgado.</description>

      <description>jordan.james[at]nottingham.ac.uk Jordan is a PhD student who joined the Cliffe group in January 2024. He is investigating the structure and quantum properties of non-stoichiometric radical MOFs using X-ray and neutron characterisation methods. Jordan graduated from the University of Bath in 2023 with a Master’s in chemistry. His research with the Burrows group at Bath looked into the control of particle size and release in MOFs.
In his spare time, Jordan likes to go on hiking trips and read the classics.</description>
