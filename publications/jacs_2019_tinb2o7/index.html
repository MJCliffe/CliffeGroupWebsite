  <h1>Ionic and Electronic Conduction in TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub></h1>

<em>Figure: TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is a battery anode material, which allows lithium ions to rapidly pass through it and is a good electrical conductor when lithium is inserted into its structure.</em></p>
<p>This work was carried out in collaboration with the groups of Prof Clare Grey and Dr Siân Dutton at the University of Cambridge, Dr Andrew Morris at the University of Birmingham and Prof Graham Henkelman at the University of Texas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.kentjgriffith.com/">Summary by Dr Kent Griffith</a></strong></p>
<p>Lithium-ion batteries are the most popular energy storage technology for
cell phones and laptops as well as a growing variety of cordless power
tools and home appliances. Increasingly, electric vehicles with large
lithium-ion battery packs are being adopted to reduce tailpipe emissions
and our reliance on fossil fuels. As we move toward intermittent
renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, we also need to change
the grid to include more energy storage. For all of these applications,
we will need better battery performance.</p>
<p>A lithium-ion battery comprises a cathode (positive electrode), an anode
(negative electrode), and an ion-conducting electrolyte. Nearly all
lithium-ion batteries use a graphite anode because it is cheap and
lightweight. However, graphite can be unsafe, particularly if it
is charged too fast or at extreme temperatures. In these conditions the
graphite can degrade, which generates heat. Even worse, graphite-based cells can be short-circuited by spindly needles of lithium (dendrites) which form on repeated use, risking fires. The use of graphite is therefore the main reason that batteries cannot charge rapidly. In this work, we investigated a
metal oxide-based anode material, TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, that is inherently much
safer. TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is also a good lithium-ion conductor, unlike other
safer anodes, and so it is being developed as a candidate for fast
charging batteries capable of being completely recharged in 10 minutes.
When designing a battery, there are always tradeoffs: TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> will
have a lower energy density than graphite-based cells but it operates
safely at higher power and in a wider range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>We used a wide range of experimental and computational methods to study
how TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> behaves as lithium is inserted into its crystal
structure. Battery electrodes must be good ion and electron conductors,
but pure TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is an electrical insulator. However, for every
lithium ion inserted into TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, an electron is also injected. We
found that when only a few electrons per metal are added TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
becomes metallic: the very act of using it as a battery electrode
improves its properties! We also used studied how the lithium moves
through the crystal structure using variable-temperature NMR
spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. In most materials, the
sites that lithium hops through are known and so the activation energy
need for Li to make the jump can be calculated. However, the complex
structure of TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> meant we needed to first carry out an
open-ended search to find the stable hopping sites. TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is known
as a crystallographic shear structure and it contains &lsquo;blocks&rsquo; of
corner-shared octahedra, separated by planes of edge-shared octahedra.
We discovered that lithium diffusion within the blocks is rapid while
diffusion between the blocks is nearly impossible. Our calculations also
allowed us to predict the barriers to motion for other ions. We found
that Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> have rather high energy barriers and so TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
is unlikely to be a suitable electrode for sodium- or potassium-ion
batteries, but that Mg<sup>2+</sup>, although it has larger barrier than Li<sup>+</sup>,
could be interesting to study, particularly as few Mg-ion conducting
materials are known.</p>
